===== PRIORITY =====

  - use jack_wait instead of our own solution
  - figure out how to restart capture in screen more without causing a failure mode
  - add VNC configuration back

===== TODO =====

  - Insure that SIGTERM sent to jack_capture saves the buffer.
  - figure out how to do opus with jack_capture
  - maybe use PHP's ini array method for cross-compatibility?

===== BUGS =====

  - Hates PulseAudio
  - jack_capture still complains about priority
